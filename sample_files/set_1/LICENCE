Copyright and Liability Statements

Preamble
Archaeological data are the product of many years of scholarship by numerous archaeologists, collectors, analysts, antiquarians, field workers and laboratory scientists. It is not possible to credit all these scholars individually, or sometimes even identify them, but in making their data available for re-use, the ADS acknowledges their contribution. At all times, the ADS seeks to protect the intellectual property rights and copyright of the originators of data where that can reasonably be achieved. The catalogue also includes links to other service providers. It is the responsibility of users to acknowledge and comply with the copyright conditions that may be imposed by other service providers.
Questions about copyright should be addressed to the Archaeology Data Service, King's Manor, The University of York, York YO1 7EP, UK. See also the ADS Common Access Agreement

In all other instances, copyright is retained by The University of York on behalf of the Archaeology Data Service (ADS). Links to materials on other servers should not be construed as a claim over them. All rights reserved.
A non-exclusive, non-transferable licence is hereby granted to those using or reproducing, in whole or in part, the material for valid not-for-profit teaching and research purposes, providing the copyright owners are acknowledged. The Archaeology Data Service should be cited as the source of the material from this server.

Anyone wishing to use the catalogue for any other purpose must contact the ADS to seek permission. 

Liability Statement
The Archaeology Data Service (ADS) catalogue of collections is a catalogue, and as such, the maintainers of the catalogue explicitly disclaim to the extent permitted by law any responsibility for the accuracy, content, or availability of Information located through use of the catalogue, or for any damage incurred owing to use of the information contained therein.

By making use of material on this web server, including the contents of the catalogue, you accept these copyright and disclaimer provisions.
The Archaeology Data Service (ADS) was founded by a consortium comprising the Council for British Archaeology with the Universities of Birmingham, Bradford, Glasgow, Kent at Canterbury, Leicester, Newcastle, Oxford and York.

The Archaeology Data Service is part funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. 

Common Access Agreement

Preamble
The Archaeology Data Service (ADS) levies no charge to use its collections when used according to the terms detailed below. However, by accepting the terms of the Common Access Agreement users are entering into a legally binding agreement. The Access Agreement covers a range of services, including both on-line and paper transactions, this preamble seeks to explain how it is implemented by the ADS (the ADS also formerly hosted AHDS Archaeology). NB: this preamble is an explanatory aid, not a legal instrument. Only the "Terms" below are legally binding.
It is the aim of the ADS to provide integrated access to a variety of data sets at no cost to end users. This aim can only be achieved if the organisations which supply data can be assured that their own rights are protected. Consequently, use of the catalogue is covered by a variety of legal instruments to protect us, our users, and those who supply data to us.
The Common Access Agreement asks that users be fair and reasonable in their use of the data supplied through the ADS. The ADS levies no charges, there are no documents to sign, and none will be applied retrospectively. We do not hold information on specific users. In return we ask that you acknowledge the source and copyright of the data you use, that you tell us of any errors you find in it, and that if you undertake any work based substantially upon it, that you tell us about it and send us a copy of any subsequent publication. The data must not be sold or supplied to a third party.
The data should only be used for teaching, learning, and research purposes. By teaching, we mean directed teaching undertaken with a designated tutor in a formal setting. By learning we mean self-directed study, whether or not attached to an educational institution, including the educational activities undertaken in museums, libraries and cognate institutions. By research we mean any work undertaken for the advancement of archaeological knowledge and/or the understanding of the historic environment. Such work may be commercially sponsored or it may be funded by academic bodies or learned societies, or it may be unsupported: but it is a condition of use that the results are placed in the public domain and are made freely available for others to use according to the normal principles of professional and academic practice.
